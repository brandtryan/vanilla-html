				<p id="p00-ln00">My teachers look at me funny when I make weird noises, but</p>
				<p id="p00-ln01">my friends, they usually just laugh. It's funny to them, and</p>
				<p id="p00-ln02">they are pretty cool about it—they don't make fun of me really</p>
				<p id="p00-ln03">but only get a kick out of it—like when we are in the middl of a</p>
				<p id="p00-ln04">test or something, and then out of nowhere I let out a bark, I</p>
				<p id="p00-ln05">mean a loud bark, where everyone turns around to me and</p>
				<p id="p00-ln06">smiles, and then someone starts laughing, and then everyone</p>
				<p id="p00-ln07">else gets going. To tell you the truth it doesn't bother me at all,</p>
				<p id="p00-ln08">and I laugh right along with them most of the time.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p01" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p01-ln00">I go to this school where our teachers are mostly nuns—we</p>
				<p id="p01-ln01">have to go to church every week, and sometimes I'll bark in</p>
				<p id="p01-ln02">church too. This one nun, Sister Agatha, told me that Jesus</p>
				<p id="p01-ln03">didn't appreciate me barking like that in church and disrupting</p>
				<p id="p01-ln04">everything. She's mean though it's funny—there's always that</p>
				<p id="p01-ln05">question about nuns—“is she mean?”—that everyone's always</p>
				<p id="p01-ln06">talkin' about whenever you find out who your teachers will be</p>
				<p id="p01-ln07">for the next year. It's always how mean Sister so and so is, and</p>
				<p id="p01-ln09">how this one cuts your hair when you're not looking if it grows</p>
				<p id="p01-ln10">too long and how another one will ask you to hold your palms</p>
				<p id="p01-ln11">out so she can smack’em with a ruler. My brother told me all</p>
				<p id="p01-ln12">kinds of horrible stuff about every nun I was gonna' have—but</p>
				<p id="p01-ln13">with Sister Agatha, he wasn't kidding. Yesterday, after telling</p>
				<p id="p01-ln14">me all about how Jesus didn't appreciate me disrupting His</p>
				<p id="p01-ln15">Mass, she smacked me in the back of the head, and told me</p>
				<p id="p01-ln16">maybe that will stop me from shaking it.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p02" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p02-ln00">I figured though, that Jesus didn't mind so much—since I</p>
				<p id="p02-ln01">prayed to Him all the time to help me to stop shaking my head,</p>
				<p id="p02-ln02">and barking, though it never seemed to help. The way I see it, if</p>
				<p id="p02-ln03">He didn't want to help, then He probably didn't care too much</p>
				<p id="p02-ln04">if I did it in church. Sister Agatha and the rest of the teachers</p>
				<p id="p02-ln05">told my mom that I was forever disrupting the classes and</p>
				<p id="p02-ln06">Masses, and that they were thinking of taking further action if</p>
				<p id="p02-ln07">I didn't stop, whatever that's supposed to mean. What they</p>
				<p id="p02-ln08">were going to do I don't know—but my mom thought</p>
				<p id="p02-ln09">something was wrong with me anyway, especially after this</p>
				<p id="p02-ln10">one time when I called my basketball coach an asshole right to</p>
				<p id="p02-ln11">his face for taking me outta' the game.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p03" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p03-ln00">The thing is, I couldn't help it—it just sorta' came out of me. I</p>
				<p id="p03-ln01">used to go over to my friend Justin's house all the time—but his</p>
				<p id="p03-ln02">dad was the basketball coach, and ever since I called his dad</p>
				<p id="p03-ln03">an asshole, I haven't been over there. Justin looks at me funny</p>
				<p id="p03-ln04">in school sometimes, like,’Why'd you have to call my dad an</p>
				<p id="p03-ln05">asshole? That's my dad, man'—and I feel real bad and all, but</p>
				<p id="p03-ln06">like I said, I couldn't help it. Anyway, I still think he shouldn't</p>
				<p id="p03-ln07">have taken me outta' the game.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p04" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p04-ln00">My mom's taking me to the hospital today to see if something's</p>
				<p id="p04-ln01">wrong with me. I do other weird stuff too—like stomping my</p>
				<p id="p04-ln02">feet and grunting, and making my face all screwed up.</p>
				<p id="p04-ln03">Sometimes I get real tired of it and really want to stop, but it's</p>
				<p id="p04-ln04">like I can't.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p05" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p05-ln00">At first it was all a big joke—because there was this one guy at</p>
				<p id="p05-ln01">the swimming pool—Crazy Charlie—who would bark right</p>
				<p id="p05-ln02">before he dove off the high dive and into the tank. He was an</p>
				<p id="p05-ln03">old man and he would do that same damn dive every time, like</p>
				<p id="p05-ln04">he was trying out for the Olympics or something—but every</p>
				<p id="p05-ln05">time his bony hands would hit the water palms up, and his one</p>
				<p id="p05-ln06">leg never seemed to be in line with the other one. Then he'd go</p>
				<p id="p05-ln07">up the ladder doing these weird twitches, stand at the end of</p>
				<p id="p05-ln08">the board, let out a bark, and then dive again. It wasn't like a</p>
				<p id="p05-ln09">little bark either—it was a huge bark, and everyone always</p>
				<p id="p05-ln10">heard it and would look up at his old ass getting ready to dive,</p>
				<p id="p05-ln11">and laugh. We imitated him a lot, walking around all the</p>
				<p id="p05-ln12">different parts of the pool, barking and twitching and yelling</p>
				<p id="p05-ln13">out “Crazy Charlie!”,’cause a lot of times Crazy Charlie himself</p>
				<p id="p05-ln14">would do that while he was walking from the showers to the</p>
				<p id="p05-ln15">sectioning tank.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p06" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p06-ln00">Rivi is the name of the pool we all go to and I spend most of</p>
				<p id="p06-ln01">my summers there, except when I'm at camp. It's like five pools</p>
				<p id="p06-ln02">all in one,’cause there are special parts of the pool for different</p>
				<p id="p06-ln03">types of things. There's the bullpen, which is my favorite,</p>
				<p id="p06-ln04">where only boys are allowed. If a girl gets caught in there she</p>
				<p id="p06-ln05">gets thrown out, and can't come back for a day. Then there's</p>
				<p id="p06-ln06">the six foot where all the codgers and old ladies do laps—the</p>
				<p id="p06-ln07">jackbox where most of the girls hang out’cause there's a bar</p>
				<p id="p06-ln08">there where they can do somersaults and stuff—and finally a</p>
				<p id="p06-ln09">baby and toddler pool which, rumor has it, is two part water</p>
				<p id="p06-ln10">and one part urine.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p07" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p07-ln00">Anyway, it was Crazy Charlie that got me goin' makin' all these</p>
				<p id="p07-ln01">weird noises—'cause before that I never did anything. I started</p>
				<p id="p07-ln02">makin' fun of him like everyone else, and then one time he</p>
				<p id="p07-ln03">looked at me, like I was the one who started all of it, and</p>
				<p id="p07-ln04">barked right at me. Well, the only thing I could do was bark</p>
				<p id="p07-ln05">right back, and when I did, my friends all laughed real hard,</p>
				<p id="p07-ln06">and patted me on the back like it was a real good one or</p>
				<p id="p07-ln07">somethin'.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p08" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p08-ln00">The thing that I remember though, is when Crazy Charlie was</p>
				<p id="p08-ln01">lookin' at me—it was like he musta' been thinking of how either</p>
				<p id="p08-ln02">he hoped we all got the barks so that we would stop laughing,</p>
				<p id="p08-ln03">or that maybe he was hopin' that we would never get’em,</p>
				<p id="p08-ln04">because it seemed to bother him a lot. Ever since that day I've</p>
				<p id="p08-ln05">been doin' the barks and twitches a lot, and I think maybe he</p>
				<p id="p08-ln06">gave’em to me when he looked right at me and I barked back at</p>
				<p id="p08-ln07">him. My mom says that's ridiculous, but she wasn't there to see</p>
				<p id="p08-ln08">the look Crazy Charlie gave me. It wasn't like an adult look—it</p>
				<p id="p08-ln09">was the look some kid gives you after you've made fun of him,</p>
				<p id="p08-ln10">like he really hates you, and would like to kill you right there</p>
				<p id="p08-ln11">on the spot.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p09" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p09-ln00">In the bullpen there's this big guy that likes to launch me into</p>
				<p id="p09-ln01">the air like a missile. That's what they call me and my friends,</p>
				<p id="p09-ln02">missiles,’cause they take one of our feet in their cupped hands</p>
				<p id="p09-ln03">and launch us through the air to see how high they can throw</p>
				<p id="p09-ln04">us. Abe is the best launcher—he's the biggest human being I've</p>
				<p id="p09-ln05">ever seen, and when he launches me I can see over the fence of</p>
				<p id="p09-ln06">the club all the way to the steeple of Meridian Street</p>
				<p id="p09-ln07">Methodist Church. My friends don't believe me, but it's true—</p>
				<p id="p09-ln08">I mean, it's not like I can prove it or anything—but I can see the</p>
				<p id="p09-ln09">steeple, and the Baskin Robbins sign right over the canal</p>
				<p id="p09-ln10">behind Rivi. I'm probably the lightest one out of all my friends,</p>
				<p id="p09-ln11">and that's why I go the highest. The funny thing is though,</p>
				<p id="p09-ln12">whenever I'm a missile I never get the urge to twitch or bark—</p>
				<p id="p09-ln13">I guess it's just because I'm too busy worrying about the flips</p>
				<p id="p09-ln14">and somersaults that I'm gonna' do. One time when Abe</p>
				<p id="p09-ln15">launched me I did three somersaults before I straightened out</p>
				<p id="p09-ln16">for a perfect dive into the water. I'm thinking I'll tell this to</p>
				<p id="p09-ln17">that doctor I'm gonna' see today, since that is practically the</p>
				<p id="p09-ln18">only time that I don't do it.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p10" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p10-ln00">On the way to Riley Hospital my mom keeps tellin' me that it's</p>
				<p id="p10-ln01">not a psychiatrist that I'm gonna' see—but a neurologist,</p>
				<p id="p10-ln02">whatever the hell that's supposed to be. She knows that I don't</p>
				<p id="p10-ln03">like crazy people, and that they are the only people who truly</p>
				<p id="p10-ln04">scare me—more than the weird things I hear in my room at</p>
				<p id="p10-ln05">night when I'm praying to Jesus to protect me from them. I</p>
				<p id="p10-ln06">remember I used to be really scared of them when I was little,</p>
				<p id="p10-ln07">at least until I got my first communion at church. After that I</p>
				<p id="p10-ln08">figured I was off limits to the monsters since I ate holy wafers</p>
				<p id="p10-ln09">on a weekly basis. But Crazy Charlie doesn't count as a crazy</p>
				<p id="p10-ln10">person to me—because it's not like he's a psycho or anything, he</p>
				<p id="p10-ln11">just does funny twitches and weird noises—not like the guys</p>
				<p id="p10-ln12">downtown who talk to themselves and look like they're about</p>
				<p id="p10-ln13">to kill somebody or somethin'. Those guys are creeps, and I try</p>
				<p id="p10-ln14">to keep clear of them whenever me and my mom go downtown</p>
				<p id="p10-ln15">to the post office.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p11" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p11-ln00">When we get to the hospital I have to sit in this waiting room</p>
				<p id="p11-ln01">that is made for little kids—there is a box of toys and a pile of</p>
				<p id="p11-ln02">children's books. I'm gettin' sorta' nervous though, because my</p>
				<p id="p11-ln03">mom says I might have this disease, and I don't want to have it.</p>
				<p id="p11-ln04">I figure that if I can stop twitching while I'm with the doctor,</p>
				<p id="p11-ln05">that he won't think I have it. I mean, I don't really care if I have</p>
				<p id="p11-ln06">it—but my mom, she gets all worried about it, like that one time</p>
				<p id="p11-ln07">she cried when my teachers at school said they might take</p>
				<p id="p11-ln08">further action—and there's one thing in the world that I can't</p>
				<p id="p11-ln09">stand, and that's my mom crying. It's like I have to cry just</p>
				<p id="p11-ln10">because my mom's crying. I don't even have to know what it's</p>
				<p id="p11-ln11">about—I start in right along with her, and ask her why she has</p>
				<p id="p11-ln12">to bawl when she knows it makes me sad.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p12" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p12-ln00">So anyway, I'm not a cry baby or anything—it's just that one</p>
				<p id="p12-ln01">thing that does it to me every time. So I'm thinking I'll hold in</p>
				<p id="p12-ln02">the urges to bark and twitch for at least a few minutes while</p>
				<p id="p12-ln03">the doctor's seein' me. That way he won't think I have it, and</p>
				<p id="p12-ln04">my mom won't have anything to get all worked up about.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p13" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p13-ln00">But in the waiting room I'm really going at it since the doctor's</p>
				<p id="p13-ln01">nowhere in sight. I pick up this book I remember having when I</p>
				<p id="p13-ln02">was a kid, The Cat In The Hat, and start reading it to get my</p>
				<p id="p13-ln03">mind off the whole situation. Only the urges are really coming</p>
				<p id="p13-ln04">at me now, since I've got this great plan to hold’em all in when</p>
				<p id="p13-ln05">the doctor shows up. I'm flipping my head back and forth and</p>
				<p id="p13-ln06">can barely even read—I'm stomping my feet, trying to get my</p>
				<p id="p13-ln07">toes through the soles of my shoes. If I could, I'd curl my toes</p>
				<p id="p13-ln08">right through the carpet and into the floor underneath. I'm</p>
				<p id="p13-ln09">grunting every other second, louder each time, and can't seem</p>
				<p id="p13-ln10">to get it right.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p14" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p14-ln00">That's the thing about it—it's like once you start in on it, you've</p>
				<p id="p14-ln01">got to get it right. Just like Crazy Charlie and his Olympic</p>
				<p id="p14-ln02">dives—if it's off by just a little bit you've got to do it again.</p>
				<p id="p14-ln03">Especially with the barks—at first everyone can barely hear it,</p>
				<p id="p14-ln04">but then I think that they didn't hear it, and so I have to do it</p>
				<p id="p14-ln05">again—but then I think that surely they didn't hear that one</p>
				<p id="p14-ln06">either, and so on, until the whole class is staring at me and I'm</p>
				<p id="p14-ln07">yanked outta' the class by Sister Agatha and sent to the</p>
				<p id="p14-ln08">principal's office.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p15" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p15-ln00">I don't really wanna' look up at my mom now,’cause I'm really</p>
				<p id="p15-ln01">having a fit, but when I do she is just staring at me like she</p>
				<p id="p15-ln02">usually does, smiling, like what I'm doing is the most normal</p>
				<p id="p15-ln03">thing in the world.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="p16" class="paragraph-container revealing-div">
				<p id="p16-ln00">Luckily there's no one else in the room—I mean, if there was a</p>
				<p id="p16-ln01">little kid in the room I'd really be feelin' stupid—'cause</p>
				<p id="p16-ln02">sometimes little kids look at me and then go over to their mom</p>
				<p id="p16-ln03">like they're afraid of me or somethin'. The urges are coming</p>
				<p id="p16-ln04">from all over, and I can't remember when I've been so bad with</p>
				<p id="p16-ln05">it——but then the doctor comes in and introduces himself to</p>
				<p id="p16-ln06">me, and not to my mom, which I think is sorta' weird since she</p>
				<p id="p16-ln07">is right there next to me. Adults are always doin' weird stuff</p>
				<p id="p16-ln08">like that when I'm around. They're always taking me aside and</p>
				<p id="p16-ln09">asking, “How are you, Brandt? Is everything okay?“ like I'm</p>
				<p id="p16-ln10">some kind of retard or something. Not that I have anything</p>
				<p id="p16-ln11">against retards, but it's like I'm not retarded—I just twitch and</p>
				<p id="p16-ln12">stuff, which isn't the same thing at all. Just like Crazy Charlie</p>
				<p id="p16-ln13">really isn't crazy.</p>

				<p id="p17-ln00">The doctor asks me to follow him down the hall to his office</p>

				<p id="p17-ln02">us but she stays behind. The doctor tells me he just wants to</p>
				<p id="p17-ln03">talk to me for a minute. We're walking down the hall and I'm</p>
				<p id="p17-ln04">really about to explode’ cause it's like there's all this energy</p>

				<p id="p32-ln02">that we're goin' to the pharmacy to get some medicine that'll</p>
				<p id="p32-ln03">make it all better. I turn to face her and tell her that I hadn't</p>
				<p id="p32-ln04">budged during the whole test, that I knew about the test, and</p>
				<p id="p32-ln05">that I hadn't done anything at all. Then she starts to cry, tears</p>
